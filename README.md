Interactive mystery puzzle added: see `index.html` for "The Vanishing Canvas — Interactive Puzzle".

To test locally:

1. Open `index.html` directly in a browser (double-click or use `file://` URL), or run a simple HTTP server:
```bash
# from workspace root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/
```

2. Stage hints for testing:
- Safe code: `0943` (enter to open the micro-safe).
- Maze glyphs: collect the carved glyphs (they translate to `ARTS`).
- Vault weight order (left→right): Feather, Paperweight, Ceramic bowl, Metal figurine, Stone tile.
